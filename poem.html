		<h1>Trees</h1>
		
		<i>BY JOYCE KILMER</i>
		<br/><br/>
		I think that I shall never see
		A poem lovely as a tree.
		<br/><br/>
		A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
		Against the earth’s sweet flowing breast;
		<br/><br/>
		A tree that looks at God all day,
		And lifts her leafy arms to pray;
		<br/><br/>
		A tree that may in Summer wear
		A nest of robins in her hair;
		<br/><br/>
		Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
		Who intimately lives with rain.
		<br/><br/>
		Poems are made by fools like me,
		But only God can make a tree.
